# Google Analytics Hybrid Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation uses a **hybrid approach** combining traditional gtag scripts with react-ga4 for optimal performance and compatibility:

### Architecture

1. **Traditional gtag Script** (in HTML head)
   - Loads immediately when page loads
   - Detected by Google Tag Assistant and validators
   - Handles initial setup and configuration

2. **React GA4 Integration** (client-side)
   - Handles SPA navigation and route changes
   - Provides React-specific event tracking
   - Manages page view tracking after navigation

### Implementation Details

- **GA Measurement ID**: `G-8SFBM8QD9M`
- **No Cookie Consent**: Removed as site targets non-EU markets
- **Immediate Loading**: Analytics starts tracking immediately on page load
- **Full Event Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking for user interactions

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Configuration
The GA measurement ID is configured in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-8SFBM8QD9M
```

### Components

1. **Layout Integration** (`app/[locale]/layout.tsx`)
   - Includes gtag scripts in HTML head for immediate detection
   - Wraps content with AnalyticsProvider

2. **AnalyticsProvider** (`components/AnalyticsProvider.tsx`)
   - Initializes React-GA4 components
   - Manages client-side analytics state

3. **GoogleAnalytics** (`components/GoogleAnalytics.tsx`)
   - Tracks route changes in SPA navigation
   - Uses Suspense boundary for static export compatibility

4. **ScrollDepthTracker** (`components/ScrollDepthTracker.tsx`)
   - Automatically tracks scroll milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

## Event Tracking

### Available Functions (`lib/analytics.ts`)

```typescript
// Track custom events
trackEvent(action, category, label?, value?)

// Track form submissions
trackFormSubmission(formName, success)

// Track CTA clicks
trackCTAClick(buttonName, location)

// Track demo requests
trackDemoRequest(source)

// Track language switches
trackLanguageSwitch(fromLang, toLang)

// Track scroll depth (automatic)
trackScrollDepth(percentage)
```

### Implemented Tracking

- ✅ **Page Views**: Automatic tracking on all routes
- ✅ **Form Submissions**: Email capture and demo request forms
- ✅ **Language Switching**: Track locale changes in header
- ✅ **Scroll Depth**: Automatic milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- ✅ **Custom Events**: Framework ready for additional tracking

## Verification

### Google Tag Assistant
The gtag script loads immediately in the HTML head, making it detectable by:
- Google Tag Assistant browser extension
- Google Analytics Tag Testing tool
- Real-time reports in GA4 dashboard

### Testing Steps
1. Visit https://kolf.app
2. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
3. Look for requests to `googletagmanager.com/gtag/js`
4. Check Real-time reports in GA4 dashboard

## Deployment

The analytics are automatically deployed with the site:
- Static HTML includes gtag scripts
- Client-side components handle dynamic tracking
- Works immediately on production at https://kolf.app

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

1. **Immediate Detection**: Traditional gtag script loads instantly
2. **React Integration**: react-ga4 provides SPA navigation tracking
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript support for all tracking functions
4. **Performance**: No cookie consent delays, immediate tracking
5. **Compatibility**: Works with Google's validation tools

## Technical Notes

- Uses Suspense boundary for `useSearchParams` in static export
- Environment variables must use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client access
- No initialization needed for react-ga4 since gtag handles setup
- All tracking functions check for browser environment before executing
