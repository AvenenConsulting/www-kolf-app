## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Ensure no TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`
- Use explicit types rather than `any`
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types with TypeScript
- Follow Next.js best practices for routing and data fetching

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Use CSS variables for theme values

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add Thai language support for hero section

- Translate all hero section strings
- Add Thai font support in Tailwind config
- Update language switcher component

Fixes #123
```

## Translation Guidelines

When adding or updating translations:

1. **Maintain consistency** across all language files
2. **Use native speakers** for translations when possible
3. **Keep the same JSON structure** in all locale files
4. **Test all languages** after making changes
5. **Consider text length** differences between languages

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new locale file in `public/locales/[locale]/common.json`
2. Add the locale to `next.config.js` i18n configuration
3. Update the language switcher component
4. Add appropriate fonts if needed
5. Test thoroughly with native speakers
